DjangoDublinCore
================

A Django plugin app for applying Dublin Core Metadata to any Django model.


This uses the Django contenttype framework and generic relations to apply a varying number of 
metadata terms to any Django model.

TODO:
0. Make tests work from clean install
1. improve install process (one cmd)
2. performance analysis - i've read that abstract classes containing datbase fields have a bad performance hit.
